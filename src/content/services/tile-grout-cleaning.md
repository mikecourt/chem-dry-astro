### Professional Tile & Grout Cleaning

Tile and grout can be difficult to keep clean. Dirt and grime build up in the porous surface of your grout lines, making them look dingy and dark. Regular mopping just moves the dirt around and can actually make the problem worse.

Brimley's White Glove Chem-Dry provides professional tile and grout cleaning that penetrates deep into the grout to remove embedded dirt and restore the original appearance of your floors.

###### Why Professional Tile Cleaning?

- **Deep Cleaning** - Removes dirt from deep within grout pores
- **Sanitizes Surfaces** - Eliminates bacteria and odor-causing residue
- **Brightens Grout** - Restores grout to its original color
- **Protects Investment** - Maintains the value of your tile flooring
- **Sealing Available** - Protective sealant helps prevent future staining

###### Our Tile & Grout Cleaning Process

We use specialized equipment and powerful cleaning solutions designed specifically for tile and grout. High-pressure jets clean deep into the grout lines while simultaneously extracting the dirty water. The result is clean, fresh tile and grout that looks like new.

After cleaning, we recommend sealing your grout lines to protect against future staining and make regular maintenance easier.

Serving Mesa and the East Valley since 1995, Brimley's White Glove Chem-Dry is your trusted source for tile and grout cleaning.
