###### Our Upholstery Cleaning Process

We begin with a careful inspection of your upholstery to identify the fabric type and any special concerns. Pre-treatment is applied to heavily soiled areas. Our carbonating cleaning solution is then applied, followed by gentle agitation to lift embedded dirt. Finally, we extract the dirt and moisture, leaving your furniture clean, fresh, and quick-drying.

Trust the experts at Brimley's White Glove Chem-Dry for all your upholstery cleaning needs in Mesa and the East Valley.
